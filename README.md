This is as web app for portfolio optimization and asset allocation. Asset allocation determines 90% of your success in the investment world. If yfinance doesn't have your desired stock market, try using investpy library. It's the greatest alternative for getting stock price data written by @alvarobartt. One other alternative is tvdatafeed which uses tradingviews as its database. However, it's more suitable for trading than investing.
